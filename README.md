# Test-Tools-Research

Research a test tool and answer the below questions about your test tool

### What is the name of the test tool?

RSpec

RSpec was created by Steven Baker with help from Dave Astels and Aslak Hellesoy. David Chelimsky later joined the team and eventually became the leader of the project.

### Give at least 3 features of this test tool.

* Compatible with 2.x versions of Ruby.
* 
* Dry run CLI option - "way to review your suite's documentation output without waiting for your specs to run or worrying about their pass/fail status."

### Does this tool do any test case storage?

I could not find anything indicating that RSpec stores test cases.

### Does this tool allow tester to link requirements or defects to test cases?

Yes, you can format API which allows you to recieve notifications only from events that you specify. I would imageine that you can use this to specify a certain event that needs further testing to other members of your team.

### If it is an automated tool, does it work with web-based tools? What languages (Java, .NET)?

RSpec is built to work with the programming language Ruby. David Chelimsky also built rspec-rails which integrates with Ruby on Rails ( a web application that helps you build other web apps with the Ruby language).
